# SecureSessionHandler

Extends PHPs [SessionHandler](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/class.sessionhandler.php) class.

Provides static functions for session management.

Throws exception on error.

## Properties settable in $config

These properties are described in [extras/includes](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/includes#session_name).

 - session_name

 - domain

 - lifetime

 - path

 - samesite

 - secure

 - alternateHijackingTest

## Public Methods:

```php
try {
  SecureSessionHandler::start_session($config);
} catch (Exception $e) {
  echo $e->getMessage();
  exit;
}
```

This function will try to use ` ini_set() ` to apply the following settings:

- [session.use_only_cookies](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-only-cookies) = 1

- [session.use_strict_mode](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-strict-mode) = 1

- [session.cookie_secure](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.cookie-secure) = the configured value of ` $config['secure'] `

- [session.use_trans_sid](https://php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php#ini.session.use-trans-sid) = 0

If these settings fail an exception will be thrown.

If a [valid session name](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.session-name.php) is not provided an exception will be thrown.

If a domain name is not provided ` $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] ` will be used.

If ` $config['alternateHijackingTest'] ` is ` false ` the users IP address and user agent will be stored in the session and compared to the values provided by the server upon each validation call which is done every time ` SecureSessionHandler::start_session() ` is called. It is not recommended that this value be set to ` true ` however, it may be necessary in situations where a users IP address is frequently changed due to network instability or service provider issues.

` $_SESSION['formKey'] ` is set to a value generated by ` bin2hex(random_bytes(32)) `. Validation will compare this value to ` $_POST['formKey'] ` on every POST request then iterate the value. An exception with the message "Session Error" will be thrown if these values don't match.

```php
echo SecureSessionHandler::outputKey();
```

Returns the current value of ` $_SESSION['formKey'] `.

```php
SecureSessionHandler::destroySession();
```

- Clears session values.

- Preserves the value of ` $_SESSION['formKey'] `.

- Destroys the current session.

- Regenerates the session ID.

```php
try {
  SecureSessionHandler::start_session($config);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  echo "<span data-value=\"error\">{$e->getMessage()}</span>";
  return FALSE;
}
echo SecureSessionHandler::outputKey();
return FALSE;
```

Sets and returns a new value for ` $_SESSION['formKey'] `.

If there is no active session an attempt will be made to create one.

## Usage:
```php
try {
  $query = new Query($config, $data);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  return $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Properties settable in $data:
   - primaryKey
     * Integer

     * Should not be set unless using PUT or DELETE.

     * An Exception will be thrown if the PUT or DELETE method are used with this property being not set.

   - endPoint
     * String

     * Valid end points:

       config, tickets, invoices, clients, o_clients, contract_locations, contract_runs, schedule_override, drivers, dispatchers

       POST, PUT, GET, DELETE

   - queryParams
     * Associative array

     * keys:
       + include / exclude:

         Indexed array of resources to retrieve / ignore from the end point. Include will be favored if both are provided. If omitted all resources are returned. Ex:

         Return only ticket number, billed client, and ticket price.
         ```php
         $data['queryParams']['include'] = [ 'TicketNumber', 'BillTo', 'TicketPrice' ];
         ```
         Return all resources __except__ pick up country.
         ```php
         $data['queryParams']['exclude'] = [ 'pCountry' ];
         ```
       + filter:
          - simple "and" query:

            Indexed array of associative arrays. Ex:

            Select tickets with charge equal to 5 and billed to clients other than client 1.
            ```php
            $data['queryParams']['filter'] = [];

            $data['queryParams']['filter'][] = ['Resource'=>'Charge', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>5];

            $data['queryParams']['filter'][] = ['Resource'=>'BillTo', 'Filter'=>'neq', 'Value'=>1];
            ```
          - complex "and" & "or" query:

            Indexed array of simple "and" queries. Ex:

            Select tickets with charge between 1 and 5 and billed to client 1 or tickets billed to client 2.
            ```php
            $filter1 = [];

            $filter1[] = ['Resource'=>'Charge', 'Filter'=>'bt', 'Value'=>'1,5'];

            $filter1[] = ['Resource'=>'BillTo', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>1];

            $filter2 = [ ['Resource'=>'BillTo', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>2] ];

            $data['queryParams']['filter'] = [$filter1, $filter2];
            ```
          - available filters:

            * cs: contain string (string contains value)
            * sw: start with (string starts with value)
            * ew: end with (string end with value)
            * eq: equal (string or number matches exactly)
            * lt: lower than (number is lower than value)
            * le: lower or equal (number is lower than or equal to value)
            * ge: greater or equal (number is higher than or equal to value)
            * gt: greater than (number is higher than value)
            * bt: between (number is between two comma separated values)
            * in: in (number is in comma separated list of values)
            * is: is null (field contains "NULL" value)
            * You can negate all filters by prepending a 'n' character, so that 'eq' becomes 'neq'.

       + order

         Indexed array of ordering parameters. With the "order" parameter you can sort. By default the sort is in ascending order, but by specifying "desc" this can be reversed. Ex:
         ```php
         $data['queryParams']['order'] = ['DispatchTimeStamp,desc'];
         ```
         or
         ```php
         $data['queryParams']['order'] = ['BillTo', 'DispatchTimeStamp,desc'];
         ```
       + page

          - string

          - The "page" parameter holds the requested page. The default page size is 20, but can be adjusted (e.g. to 50). Pages that are not ordered cannot be paginated. EX:

          ```php
          $data['queryParams']['page'] = '1';
          ```
          or
          ```php
          $data['queryParams']['page'] = '1,50';
          ```
        + join

          - Indexed array of tables to join via Foreign Key Constraint.

          ```php
            $data['endPoint'] = 'clients';
            $data['method'] = 'get';
            $data['queryParams']['filter'][] = ['Resource'=>'ClientID', 'Filter'=>'eq', 'Value'=>0];
            $data['queryParams']['join'] = [ 'config' ];
          ```

          This query will return the client with all resources plus an extra resource named 'config' with all of the resources from that end point.

          If the filter were left off all clients would have the extra resource however, it would only be populated for Client 0.

          - Joins currently available:

            * Client 0 to config

            * Invoice to tickets

            * Contract run to contract locations

            * Contract run to contract run schedule

            * Contract run to schedule override

            * Route to route schedule

            * Route to schedule override

            * Route to route tickets

## Public Methods

```php
$query->buildURI();
```
Processes the queryParams property into a query string then returns itself so that it can be chained with the call method.

```php
$query->call();
```
Uses the cURL library to execute the query string. Returns the result of the query or throws Exception on error. Ex:

```php
try {
  $query->buildURI()->call();
} catch (Exception $e) {
  return $e->getMessage();
}
```

# LoginHandler

Extends [CommonFunctions](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice#commonfunctions)

Processes login credentials.

Populates ` $_SESSION ` with user data.

Returns string; either '/clients' or '/drivers'.

Throws exception on error.

## Usage

```php
try {
  $handler = new LoginHandler($config, $data);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  return $e->getMessage();
}
```
## Properties settable in $data:

- clientID

  Users login name.
  * Repeat clients: Integer. ClientID.
  * Non-repeat clients: String. ClientID preceded by the letter 't'. ` t1 `
  * Organizations: String.  ` orgLogin `
  * Drivers: String. DriverID preceded by the word 'driver'. ` driver1 `
  * Dispatchers: String. DispatchID preceded by the word 'dispatch'. ` dispatch23 `
- upw

  Users password.

## Public Methods

```php
try {
  $type = $handler->login();
} catch(Exception $e) {
  echo $e->getMessage();
  return false;
}
echo $type;
return false;
```

Sets the following session values:

```php
$_SESSION['config']
```

This associative array contains resources from the [config](https://rjdeliveryomaha.com/courierinvoice/apidoc#config) endpoint as well as all Client 0 resources except ` Password `, ` AdminPassword `, and ` Deleted `.


```php
$_SESSION['mobile']
```

If ` true ` this Boolean value indicates that the user logged in from a portal located at ../mobileLogin that passed the LoginHandler class a dataset that included the key "mobile" and will redirect there instead of / upon log out.

```php
$_SESSION['ulevel']
```

Describes the type of user logged in:

  - 0: Organization

  - 1: Admin Client

  - 2: Daily Client

  - driver

  - dispatch

All resources from the end point corresponding to the client, organization, driver, or dispatcher except ` Deleted ` and passwords.

Dispatchers have ` $_SESSION['CanDispatch'] ` set to a value of 2.

Clients, Dispatchers, and Drivers with dispatch privileges have ` $_SESSION['config']['ContractDiscount'] ` and ` $_SESSION['config']['GeneralDiscount'] ` set. These are associative arrays with keys being Client IDs (preceded with the letter 't' for non-repeat clients) and the values being the discount values for each (or current) client.

Clients and organizations will have ` $_SESSION['pwWarning'] ` set.

Integer

  - 0: password did not match the default password for the login type.

  - 1: daily client password is default

  - 2: admin client password is default

  - 3: both daily and admin clients are default

  - 4: organization password is default

These values are used to notify the user that the password should be changed.

Organizations have ` $_SESSION['members'] ` set. This is an associative array with the keys being client IDs (preceded by the letter 't' for non-repeat clients) and the values being an associative array containing the data stored at the clients end point for each client associated with the organization.

# Ticket

Extends [CommonFunctions](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice#commonfunctions)

Processes and displays tickets individually or batched

## Usage:

```php
try {
  $ticket = new Ticket($config, $data);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  return $e->getMessage();
}
```

## Properties settable in $data:

A list of standard properties can be found in the [API Documentation](https://www.rjdeliveryomaha.com/courierinvoice/apidoc#tickets)

The ` step ` property is used by ` $ticket->updateStep() `.

The ` action ` property is used by ` $ticket->cancelTicket() `.

The special property ` multiTicket ` can contain an array of ticket data sets for batch creation or updating. Ex: Update two tickets; one is being delivered the other returned to the same address.

```php
$data['multiTicket'] = [
  [
    'ticket_index': 1,
    'step': 'delivered',
    'notes': 'This ticket was delivered'
  ],
  [
    'ticket_index': 2,
    'step': 'returned'
  ]
]
```

## Public Methods:

```php
echo $ticket->regenTicket();
```

Display single ticket for client review or for dispatch.

If coordinates are available for pick up, delivery, or return step the will be displayed in a span with the class coordinates.

```php
echo $ticket->displaySingleTicket();
```

Display single ticket for drivers.

Addresses are displayed as ` a.addressLink ` that by default will open Google Maps searching the address in a new window.

```php
echo $ticket->displayMultiTicket();
```

Display groups of tickets with common pick up or drop off location and time.

Addresses are displayed as ` a.addressLink ` that by default will open Google Maps searching the address in a new window.

```php
echo $ticket->ticketsToDispatch();
```

Check database for tickets that have not been dispatched.

```php
echo $ticket->ticketForm();
```

Has 4 states based on $data passed to Ticket.

1 initial: Generates an empty ticket entry form.

  This form is followed by ` <div class="mapContainer" id="map"></div> ` for use with a javascript map api.

  This div is only generated on this step.

2 edit: Generates a ticket entry form populated with provided ` $data `.

3 confirmation: Generates a read-only form for validation.

  TicketPrice is solved here.

4 process: Submit ticket to the server.

  TicketNumber is set here.

```php
echo $ticket->runPriceForm();
```

Generates a simplified ticket form that only accepts 2 addresses, charge, and dry ice weight.

The data from this form should be passed to ` $ticket->calculateRunPrice() `.

This form is followed by ` <div class="mapContainer" id="map2"></div> ` for use with a javascript map api.

```php
echo $ticket->calculateRunPrice();
```

__Note__:
The private method ` self::getTicketBase() ` is called here as well as when creating on call tickets and contract tickets that have a ` PriceOverride ` value of 0. This method uses [geocoder-php](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder) to get the coordinates of the pick up and delivery locations. It expects that the properties ` $ticket->pAddress2 ` and ` $ticket->dAddress2 ` will be in the format _Locality/City, State/Province Zip/Postal Code_. This format is important as the function tests the value between the first comma and the final whitespace in the string (the one prior to Zip/Postal Code) against values returned by the geocoder to determine if accurate data has been received.

Returns a json encoded array with the following properties:

- billTo: ClientID.
- address1: Pick up address.
- address2: Delivery address.
- result1: Coordinates of address1.
- result2: Coordinates of address2.
- center: Coordinates of mid-point between result1 and result2.
- pRangeTest: The distance between address1 and RangeCenter.
- dRangeTest: The distance between address2 and RangeCenter.
- rangeDisplay: The distance between address1 and address2.
- runPrice: The calculated price without dry ice.
- ticketPrice: The calculated price with dry ice.
- diWeight: The weight of dry ice provided for the calculation.
- diPrice: The calculated price of dry ice.

```php
echo $ticket->fetchTodaysTickets();
```

Checks for tickets for a given client on the current date.

Returns the results of ` $ticket->regenTicket() ` for each ticket found, false if none exist.

```php
$ticket->processRouteTicket();
```

__Note__: This does not display a map when calculating TicketPrice. Consult [geocoder providers](https://github.com/geocoder-php/Geocoder#providers) for limitations.

Process tickets generated by the Route class:

- Sets TicketNumber

- Solves TicketPrice or uses the resource stored at the contract_runs end point if PriceOverride is ` true `

- Submits tickets

- Updates LastCompleted date at the contract_runs end point

Returns true on success, false, and optionally logs an error, on failure.

```php
$ticket->processReturnTicket();
```

Processes and submits a change of charge from 5 to 6 using the value stored in TicketBase.

```php
echo $ticket->updateTicketProperty();
```

Updates values in ` $ticket->updateTicketDatabaseKeys ` if provided.

```php
$ticket->updateTicketDatabaseKeys = ['BillTo',
                                     'Charge',
                                     'EmailAddress',

Creates contract tickets for a driver as defined on the Manage Runs page.

Checks for and displays contract tickets.

Updates LastSeen resource.

Checks for and displays on call tickets.

Checks for and displays transferred tickets.

## Usage:

```php
try {
  $route = new Route($config, $data);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  echo $e->getMessage();
  return FALSE;
}
```

## Properties settable in $data:

All properties of this class are set by the session.

## Public Methods:

```php
$route->routeTickets();
```

Checks drivers LastSeen resource. If it is not the current date a call is made to check for cancelations and rescheduling then tickets defined on the Manage Runs page are created. The LastSeen resource is then updated.

__Note__: The above order is overriding. Canceling a run on a given date supersedes rescheduling that run to the same date. Rescheduling a run supersedes its date, pick up time, delivery time, and return time defined on the Manage Runs page.

A call is made to fetch incomplete routine and round trip contract tickets. If this result is empty a call is made to check if any contract tickets were created for the driver on the current day.

Multiple tickets with the same location and scheduled step time will be grouped together.

Soft delete (setting the 'Deleted' property to 1) of contract runs, contract run schedules, rescheduling events, cancelations, and route schedules is respected.

Soft delete of contract locations that are associated with active contract runs is not respected.

A ` span.timing ` element is added to each ` div.sortable ` for use by javascript to order tickets based on their ` ReadyDate ` and ` step `.

Returns HTML content.

```php
$route->onCallTickets();
```

Checks for incomplete on call tickets that have been dispatched to the current driver in the past 7 days.

Returns HTML content.

```php
$route->transferredTickets();
```

Checks for tickets that have been transferred to or by the current driver.

Returns HTML content.

# Scheduling

Static Class with tools for interpreting scheduling codes, literals, and indices.

## Public methods

```php
Scheduling::codeFromIndex($index);
```

Returns the schedule code ([a-g][1-9] or h5 - h28) associated with a given schedule_index (1-87).

```php
Scheduling::literalFromIndex($index);
```

Returns the schedule literal (Every Day, Every Last Thursday, Every 22nd) associated with a given schedule_index (1-87).

```php
Scheduling::indexFromCode($code);
```

Returns the schedule_index (1-87) associated with a given schedule code ([a-g][1-9] or h5 - h28).

```php
Scheduling::literalFromCode($code);
```

Returns the schedule literal (Every Day, Every Last Thursday, Every 22nd) associated with a schedule code ([a-g][1-9] or h5 - h28).

```php
Scheduling::indexFromLiteral($literal);
```

Returns the schedule_index (1-87) associated with a given schedule literal (Every Day, Every Last Thursday, Every 22nd).

```php
Scheduling::codeFromLiteral($literal);
```

Returns the schedule code ([a-g][1-9] or h5 - h28) associated with a given schedule literal (Every Day, Every Last Thursday, Every 22nd).

```php
Scheduling::testIndex($index, $startDate, $testDate);
Scheduling::testCode($code, $startDate, $testDate);
Scheduling::testLiteral($literal, $startDate, $testDate);
```

Compares two ``` DateTime ``` objects to determine if the scheduled interval has elapsed.

Returns ``` boolean ```.

__Note__: For 'Every Other' schedules with day names, if the start date does not land on the named day, perhaps because the schedule changed, the date will be tested against the day of the scheduled name in the same Sunday through Saturday week as the start date.

For example if an Every Other Saturday schedule starting on 01 JUL 2017 were changed to an Every Other Tuesday schedule the current date would be tested against the Tuesday in the same week as 01 JUL 2017 which is 27 JUN 2017.

By default canceled thickets are not displayed. This behavior can be adjusted on a per client basis in the config file located at [extras/includes](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/includes).

By default contract tickets are consolidated by run number. This behavior can be adjusted on a per client basis in the config file located at [extras/includes](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/includes).

## Usage:

```php
try {
  $invoice = new Invoice($config, $data);
} catch(Exception $e) {
  echo $e->getMessage();
  return FALSE;
}
```

## Properties settable in $data:

A list of standard properties can be found in the [API Documentation](https://www.rjdeliveryomaha.com/courierinvoice/apidoc#invoices)

The ` invoiceQueryResult ` property is an indexed array of invoice datasets used for receiving data from the [SearchHandler](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice#searchHandler) class.

## Public Methods:

```php
$invoice->regenInvoice();
```

Uses the data provided in ` invoiceQueryResult ` to display an invoice.

If [dompdf](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf) is detected a button will be added to display/download the invoice as a pdf.

If multiple datasets are provided a form will be returned to select which invoice to recreate by invoice number.

Soft delete (setting the 'Deleted' property to 1) will result in a discreet message being displayed at the top of the invoice indicating that it has been flagged for deletion.

```php
$invoice->invoiceQueryForm();

# extras

This is an extendable drop-in implementation of this set of classes using vanilla javascript.

Functionality is enclosed in a global variable: ` rjdci `.

The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#Browser_compatibility) is used extensively and a template is provided. This will retry a call failing due to network issues 20 times waiting ` n * 250 ` milliseconds between calls where n is the retry count. If a ` FormData ` instance is sent the headers ` Content-Type ` and ` Content-Length ` will be tested for and removed to prevent conflicts. If the postData property is not empty and the ` Content-Type ` header is set as ` www-form-urlencoded ` the post body will be encoded. If the Content-Type header is not defined and the postData property has a length greater than 0 the Content-Type will be set to "application/json". As a result the PHP ` $_POST ` super global is not populated; data must be read from the stream.

Ex:

```php
  if (empty($_POST)) $_POST = json_decode(file_get_contents('php://input'),true);
```

```javascript
  rjdci.fetch_template = async ({ url, method = "POST", headers = {}, postData = {}, retry = 0 }) => {
    if (!url) throw new Error("URL not defined");
    let fetchOptions = {
        method: method.toUpperCase(),
        headers: headers
      };
    if (postData instanceof FormData || Object.keys(postData).length > 0) {
      let body;
      if (postData instanceof FormData) {
        body = postData;
        fetchOptions.headers["Content-Type"] &&
        delete fetchOptions.headers["Content-Type"];
        fetchOptions.headers["Content-Length"] &&
        delete fetchOptions.headers["Content-Length"];
      } else if (fetchOptions.headers["Content-Type"].indexOf("x-www-form-urlencoded") != -1) {
        body = Object.entries(postData).map(([key, value]) =>
          `${encodeURIComponent(key)}=${encodeURIComponent(value)}`).join("&");
      } else {
        body = JSON.stringify(postData);
        if (!headers.hasOwnProperty("Content-Type")) {
          fetchOptions.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json";
        }
      }
      fetchOptions.method = "POST";
      fetchOptions.body = body;
    }
    try {
      return await fetch(url, fetchOptions);
    } catch(err) {
      retry++;
      if (retry === 20) throw err;
      await rjdci.pause(250 * retry)
      return await rjdci.fetch_template({
        url: url,
        method: method,
        headers: headers,
        postData: postData,
        retry: retry
      });
    }
  }
```

The ``` rjdci.pause ``` function is setTimeout turned into a promise.

```javascript
  rjdci.pause = duration => { return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, duration)) };
```

Usage:

```javascript
  // example taken from rjdci.refreshRoute()
  let postData =  { "formKey": document.querySelector("#formKey").value };
  await rjdci.fetch_templet({ url: "./refreshRoute.php", postData: postData })
  .then(result => {
    if (typeof result === "undefined") throw new Error("Result Undefined");
    if (result.ok) {
      return result.text();
    } else {
      throw new Error(result.status + " " + result.statusText);
    }
  })
  .then(data => {
    if (data.indexOf("error") !== -1) throw new Error(data);
    let parser = new DOMParser(),
      newDom = parser.parseFromString(data, "text/html"),
      docFrag = document.createDocumentFragment();
    Array.from(newDom.querySelectorAll(".sortable")).forEach(element => {
      docFrag.appendChild(element);
    });
    setTimeout(() => {
      document.querySelector("#route").appendChild(docFrag);
      rjdci.assignListeners();
      rjdci.fixDeadRunButton();
      sortRoute();
    }, 2000);
  })
  .then(rjdci.refreshFormKey)
  .catch(error => {
    document.querySelector("#route").innerHTML = '<p class="center"><span class="error">Error</span>: ' + error.message + "</p>";
  });
```

A place holder for a map function is provided and should be redefined if a map api is implemented.

```javascript
  rjdci.updateMap = ({ coords1, address1, coords2, address2, center, mapDivID }) => { return false; }

[Signature Pad v2.3.2](https://github.com/szimek/signature_pad) is preconfigured with [extras/public_html/app_js/sigPad.js](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/public_html/app_js/sigPad.js) to collect signatures in conjunction with the functions ` $ticket->displaySingleTicket() ` and ` $ticket->displayMultiTicket() `.

The method ` rjdci.toast(msg, options) ` is available. It creates and deletes a toast-like div to show messages to the user.

Usage:

```javascript
  let options = {},
      msg = "Test Message"; // or ['Test Message'] or [ 'Multi-line', 'Test Message' ];
  options.title = "sample div title"; // title attribute of toast div. default ""
  options.time = 3000; // milliseconds to show toast div. div will be removed 1 second after it is hidden. default 4000
  options.eleClass = "ticketOncallReceived"; // custom class for the toast div. The function will display only the newest of a custom class, removing previous messages. All default class divs will be displayed for the configured time. default "toast__msg"
  options.datatime = 1512574797926; // unix time stamp to parse for display with message. default new Date().getTime();
  rjdci.toast(msg, options);
```

The method ` rjdci.getSpinner() ` can be called to return a copy of the loading icon.

### Features

Uses ticket information from database to populate datalist elements to assist form completion.

Single page design navigated by either swipe or menu. Offers unique features based upon user type. Once each page has been loaded a window event ` rjdci_loaded ` is triggered.

[Swipe](https://github.com/lyfeyaj/swipe) is used for navigation. [Public methods](https://github.com/lyfeyaj/swipe#api)  can be accessed via the ` rjdci.Swipe ` instance.

At the end of the transition between pages ` scroll(0,0) ` is called and a window event  ` rjdci_pageChange ` is triggered.

Setting the order of menu items as well as adding custom menu items (with or without matching pages), and javascript files is handled in the config file located at [extras/includes](https://github.com/rjdeliveryomaha/courierinvoice/tree/master/extras/includes).

### Drivers

If the user agent supports both the [permissions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API) and [geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) APIs an attempt will be made to get the coordinates when a ticket is picked up, delivered, returned, declined, or marked as a dead run. The above described function ` rjdci.toast ` is used to create notifications with the class ` deliveryLocation ` to inform the user of the status of updating the delivery location.
